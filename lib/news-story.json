Because of the coronavirus pandemic, colleges across the country sent students home in March and shifted to online instruction. But this month the focus has already moved to addressing the massive revenue losses and cost increases that colleges must absorb, both in the current year and for the upcoming one.A sign of how large the financial problems have quickly become is that institutions have already reached the stage of furloughing staff. A furlough is an unpaid leave of absence. It can be imposed for a consecutive number of days, or it can be served intermittently across a semester or year. Unlike layoffs, furloughed employees remain employees of the institution and often retain benefits such as employer-provided health insurance. Under certain circumstances, furloughed employees may be eligible for unemployment payments. When institutions furlough rather than terminate employees itâ€™s often because they hope to be able to bring the employees back to work after the school recovers from its financial difficulties."}
